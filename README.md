## 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Forecast Dashboard — Power BI + Python + OpenWeatherMap API

### 📘 Project Overview

This project showcases a real-time weather forecasting dashboard built in Power BI, integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide dynamic and up-to-date weather insights. The dashboard presents 5-day forecasts with 3-hour intervals, offering users detailed information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and other meteorological parameters in an interactive and visually appealing interface.

### ⚙️ ETL & Data Processing
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieved live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using Python scripts.
- **Data Transformation**: Performed data recording, type conversion, and cleaning within Power BI and Python to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Loading**: Integrated the cleaned and transformed data model into Power BI for real-time visualization and analysis.

### 🧠 Data Modeling & DAX Calculations
- Designed a robust data model in Power BI, establishing relationships among multiple tables.
- Created DAX measures and calculated columns to compute KPIs such as average temperature, humidity trends, wind direction, and forecasted conditions.
- Developed summary tables for daily, hourly, and condition-based weather insights.
